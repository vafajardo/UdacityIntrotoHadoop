<p>When you are logged in you should try to find a unregistered ""nickname"" and register it. Once you get that done you can go to #freenode channel and request having a ""Cloak"" applied to your nickname. One of the reasons is that without a cloak someone can easily look up your IP Address through your hostname which usually looks something like ""12-34-5-678.LA.fios.verizon"" .

<p>I 'm ""expanding"" a bit my blog app, and I came up with the necessity to save a set of values (namely my blog settings) in a place where they could be accessed from every Python module. I came up with the idea of creating a new GAE datastore called Data and save each value as a database tuple. The scheme of the entities looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Data(db.Model):
    name = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    textvalue = db.StringProperty(required=False)
    intvalue = db.IntegerProperty(required=False)
    lastedit = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_add = True)
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to store there stuff like the number of posts per page I want in the homepage, the number of written posts (so I don't have to count them each time I need to) and so on.</p>
<p>I'd like to know your opinions on this. Is it a good practice to do such things? Or should I store the values some other way?</p>

"64431"	""	"cs101 "	"100005175"	"<p>I posted <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/60158/feedback-on-the-course"" rel=""nofollow"">some feedback</a> which touched on this--I mentioned wanting to really work to be successful--but I'd like to expand on that a bit, here.</p>
<p>I studied math at uni, and if you'd say that a 'weeder course' is one that throws difficult material at students so they must either sink or swim, then nearly all of the classes I took were like this. And because I was able to 'swim', I very much liked the classes being that way, because they forced me to work hard and do my best, and as a result I learnt much more than if the course had moved more slowly in order to ensure that everyone learned the material equally.</p>
<p>Of course, if it were possible to teach the same amount of material, but have more students succeed, then I think that is certainly the right thing to do. But I'm not sure that's always possible. Or, where it is possible, I'm not sure that it's in general within the ability of the professors to do it.</p>
<p>For some online classes like Udacity offers, certainly people may continue trying and studying until they understand, but, realistically, not everyone is going to manage to do it within seven weeks, no matter how well explained or easy the material may be. There may be people who will struggle for seven weeks just trying to understand the first unit. And that's okay, because not everyone must learn at the same rate. But there is not such freedom if you are offering an in-person class at a university.</p>
<p>Basically, we must weigh the benefits of teaching a harder class vs. an easier class. Some people have said before me, here, that if the goal is to teach the most people the most knowledge, then weeding out any people at all is counterproductive. But if resources are scarce--teaching time, for example--then by weeding out a few of the worst performing students, all of the rest might benefit enough that it makes up for it. In a physical university, the people who are weeded out then must take a different class, maybe changing their major or perhaps they will even drop out altogether, and it's a shame, but it would be worse to serve everyone poorly than to serve most better and few poorly or not at all, I think. Certainly people are free to study on their own, but the universities must also limit the resources expended on each student.</p>
<p>The beauty of Udacity, though, is that it can offer classes of comparable difficulty to 'weeder' classes <i>without needing to actually weed out any students</i>. Even if a student is failing every homework assignment, they won't be forced out, and there's no incentive to force them out. So for online classes like this, the value calculus changes. Now you can just teach the best class possible, and continue to iterate until you serve better those who were poorly served at first, because the presence of poorly performing students doesn't hurt those who are performing well. People are free to continue to spend their time trying to learn for as long as they feel it's in their best interests.</p>
<p>So, I think that by all means Udacity should offer courses that are like weeder courses. Throw as much material as possible at students, and see what sticks. But also offer all the explanations and help that are needed to help <i>everyone</i> learn the material. Then, those who can learn the material more easily may continue to have lots of challenging material to study, and those who need more help may get it. And let the path through the course be chosen by the student. Already Udacity is like this--for those students who need no help with the homework, they may choose not to view the 'office hours' videos, and not to request help in the forums. For those who need more help, there are many avenues they may explore. If Udacity continues to build on this, then I think it may combine the best of both options. I hope that it does.</p>"	"answer"	"64092"	"64092"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100005175"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"85102"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"
